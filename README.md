Sure, here's a sample README that explains the Angular quiz application challenge:

# Angular Quiz Application Challenge

This challenge requires you to create an Angular application that quizzes users on their Angular knowledge. The application should have three components: QuizComponent, QuestionComponent, and ResultComponent. The QuizComponent controls the quiz flow and displays questions, the QuestionComponent handles individual questions and user input, and the ResultComponent showcases the final quiz results.

## Components

### QuizComponent

The QuizComponent should use the QuizService to retrieve questions and display them one at a time. You can use *ngFor directive to iterate over the questions array and show each question. Also, you can use *ngIf directive to display only one question at a time. When the user answers a question, you will need to emit an event that notifies the QuizComponent to display the next question.

### QuestionComponent

The QuestionComponent should handle individual questions and user input. You can use @Input() to receive the question and its options from the QuizComponent, and @Output() to emit the user's answer back to the QuizComponent. You can use radio buttons to allow the user to select only one option.

### ResultComponent

The ResultComponent should display the final quiz results. You can use @Input() to receive the user's score from the QuizComponent.

## Service

### QuizService

The QuizService should store and manage an array of questions, options, and correct answers. This service should provide the questions to the QuizComponent.

## Criteria

- Use the QuizService to provide questions to QuizComponent.

- Employ @Input() and @Output() decorators to pass data between components.

- Implement event emitters in the QuestionComponent.

- Show the ResultComponent after the last question, and calculate the user's score.

## Bonus Points

- Add a countdown timer.

- Enable answer review after completion.

- Incorporate animations or transitions.

- Implement routing for navigation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `ng serve`.
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your web browser to view the application.

## Conclusion

This challenge will test your Angular skills by requiring you to create a quiz application that showcases your knowledge of Angular components, services, and event emitters. By following the provided criteria and bonus points, you can demonstrate your proficiency in Angular development.
